# **UNIT I**
 ## Web Fundamentals

Having the ability to craft user interface is key for full stack web developers in all organizations. Another key ability for professional developers is knowing how to use git. We cover both topics throughout the week culminating in a multi-page website sprint challenge.

The goal of this sprint is to build user interfaces and introduce git into our work flow. Concepts covered: Semantic HTML, box model, display types, layout techniques, flex box, basic terminal use, basic git use.

## **User Interface and Git**
### User Interface I:
_Even the most complex web applications start with simple HTML elements. Knowing how to use HTML and style it with CSS has a massive impact for your future as a developer. This module will explore the fundamentals of HTML and CSS._

### Git for Web Development
_Git is a distributed version control system. What does that mean to a new web developer? It means that git is used to monitor and control code changes made during development across several people or teams._

### User Interface III:
_As we progress into more advanced UI layout techniques we learn about the Flexible Box Module also known as flexbox. There are many ways to layout a page in CSS but flexbox is one of the most powerful and simple ways to do it. We will discuss the basics of what flexbox is and how we use it properly to build a user interface._

### Responsive Design
_Responsive design covers topics that range from fixed layouts to fully responsive websites. Responsive design addresses accessibility challenges and how developers can use flexible units to overcome them. On top of being accessible, fully responsive websites are a joy to use and push web development forward into the future._

### Responsive Design II
_Understanding the problem vs fixing a problem are two different things. We aim to fix the problems presented by the thousands of devices we are required to develop for. This module will address techniques that will push your ability to code a responsive website or app further._

### Preprocessing I
_Preprocessing is simply a more robust syntax for CSS written in a different language. That language is then compiled into normal CSS.
This is the most straightforward explanation of CSS preprocessors:_

_Syntax (LESS/SCSS) > Compiler (JavaScript) > CSS_

_Beyond that is just syntax and study of the documentation. With practice, preprocessing can increase productivity and decrease errors. Once you learn how to use a preprocessor, you won’t want to use CSS without it ever again!_

### Preprocessing II
_Preprocessing opens up tools earlier web developers could never dream of. Mixins, functions, and namespaces were never available to CSS until preprocessors came along. Understanding how to use these new tools can separate an average user interface developer from a great one. Knowing these skills will make layouts so easy that the programmer can spend their valuable time on deeper logic in other more advanced languages._

### Sprint Challenge:
_This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS techniques using Responsive Design and Preprocessing. During this Sprint, you studied how to use the viewport meta tag, media queries, setting up a preprocessor, and advanced use of preprocessing techniques. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by updating a website that is missing content as well as adding mobile styling._

## **Javascript Fundamentals**
_I love to look at JavaScript through this analogy. Think of a web page as a house. You need someone to architect and get in the structure of your house, someone to add in the design, and someone to add in the electricity to power the house. If you were to think about HTML, CSS and JavaScript as the three necessary building blocks, for a web page, HTML could be the architecture/layout of what your house should be, CSS is the design/style of your house and JavaScript powers the electrical interactions that our house needs to have in order to be functional._

### Javascript I
_This challenge focuses on functions, objects and arrays. You'll convert "traditional" functions into functions that use the ES6 arrow syntax. You'll also manipulate objects and traverse arrays._

 - [x] [Project I - Objects, Functions and Arrays OH MY!]('https://github.com/rockyFierro/JS-Exercise-Functions-Arrays-Objects')

### Javascript II
_Throughout JavaScript II we’re going to be getting more practice with Callbacks as well as dive into a couple of new concepts. By the end of the day you should be familiar with and have the ability to use closure, callback functions, and advanced array methods._

- [x] [Project I - Closures, Callbacks, Arrays TO THE MAX!]('https://github.com/rockyFierro/JS-Exercise-Closures-Callbacks-ArrayMethods')

### Javascript III : The Return of (the, return)
_JavaScript III introduces us to the this keyword and it’s many uses. After we learn about this we are prepared to discuss prototypes in JavaScript and explore how they are in every aspect of JavaScript._

- [x] [Project I - Classes]('https://github.com/rockyFierro/JS-Exercise-Classes')

### Javascript IV : The Prototype Awakens
_JavaScript IV introduces you to the powerful paradigm of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript. We will take a deep dive into these topics: The JavaScript Prototype object, constructor functions, Pseudo-classical Inheritence, the class keyword.
By the end of the day you should be familiar with objects and how to use Constructors and Classes to build out objects and achieve inheritance across these objects._

- [x] [Project I - Prototypes]('https://github.com/rockyFierro/JS-Exercise-Prototype')

### Sprint Challenge:
_This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a survey of problems. This Sprint explored JavaScript Fundamentals. During this Sprint, you studied variables, functions, object literals, arrays, this keyword, prototypes, and class syntax. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by completing a survey of JavaScript problems._

# **UNIT 2**

## Web Applications
_This unit is all about exposing you to applying your Javascript knowledge to the Document Object Model and creating rich Javascript user interfaces._

__________________________

### DOM I

_Now that we can build a basic static web page with HTML and CSS, we need to add functionality to the page. The first step in building vibrant dynamic web pages and applications is learning about the DOM. What it is, how it affects our page, and how to access and manipulate it. DOM manipulation is at the core of every framework and before we start using frameworks we need to understand the DOM._

- [ ] [Project I - DOM Manipulation Challenge]('https://github.com/rockyFierro/Unit2_dom_I/tree/rocky-fierro')

### DOM II

_Events are the way we users interact with the page. Any time there is some interaction by way of a mouse, keyboard, etc., the DOM creates and propagates an event object. This event object carries information about the event so that it may be handled at any point up the tree from the point of origin._

### Components I

_As we build larger and more feature rich web pages, we may notice a trend in our code; elements that are essentially using the same functionality and styling with minor differences in the data they present. In an effort to keep our code readable, reusable, and most of all DRY, we can build on these repeating patterns and create components. Components are reusable pieces of code that can be used to build elements sharing functionality and styling. Components are the heart of any dynamic web application and JavaScript framework._
